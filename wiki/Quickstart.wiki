Quickstart:

 * Install Arduino software: http://arduino.cc/en/main/software
 * Install Ludwig/Lonestar/Alois gimbal firmware 049A_r45: http://code.google.com/p/brushless-gimbal/ 
 * Download and install the (043) B-Gimbal windows package of your windows version. 
 * Download the latest zipped B-Gimbal_0.49A_r45 update file and extract B-Gimbal in the install folder. 
 * Make sure to mount your MPU6050 upside down (chips below)!. Only then the controller works and visual output wil look correctly. 
 * Connect the gimbal controller to USB and external power (for driving motors). 
 * Run B-Gimbal and choose the correct controller comm port (must be 1-16). 
 * Push the "Connect" button to read settings from the controller Eeprom. 
 * While PID tuning push the "ON" button to watch the movement of Artificial Horizon and other graphical tools. 
 * In between push the "Gyro Recalibrate" button to see the effect of settings. 
 * For Definitions push the "load Definitions" button and browse to the Lonestar gimbal folder called BruGi and choose the definitions.h file. Make changes and activate with "Arduino" button. When using "Quit" button changes will be remembered. 

Enjoy and/or report your bugs and remarks ;)!
